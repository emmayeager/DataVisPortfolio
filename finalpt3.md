### Final audience

My audience remained pretty close to the group I outlined in part 2: people who may hold similar beliefs to mine (like wanting to be part of more livable and just communities), but who don't know much about eviction and the policies that could be used to prevent it. I refined the audience to only include people who live in Pittsburgh. Limiting to a local audience helped me develop my call to action, which shared some policies worth supporting as well as eviction prevention resources. The call to action won't be as relevant to people who live outside Pittsburgh since eviction policy is made primarily at the local level.

### Incorporating last week's feedback

The major change I made from last week was in the progression of my story. My journalist friend gave me some advice for this last week that I leaned on heavily. The new flow starts off my explaining the magnitude of the current problem: how many people in the U.S. are at risk of eviction today and what the consequences could be if evictions are filed against them. Then, the description of the pandemic-era policies (now with more data) motivate the push to build better housing policies now. Other than those changes to the story arc, I also pulled in more finished data visualizations and implemented the smaller changes suggested by my interviewees.

### Last thoughts

This was a challenging project! While I'm happy with the product I have so far, I may spend some more time with it after the course wraps up. There are other data sources I still want to explore. I was also inspired by my classmate's projects, especially the creative Shorthand designs and visualizations some people were able to achieve. I might look into using Canva more: I had fun using it to make an infographic presenting the eviction outcomes data, and am wondering if I could use it to make more exciting designs for the rest of the story. I'd like to update the transition slides to something more exciting than just photos pulled from Unsplash.

This project involved some behind-the-scenes work, like processing the Eviction Lab data (see the code [here](https://github.com/emmayeager/DataVisPortfolio/blob/main/eviction_filings_processing.py)) and scraping the Household Pulse Survey (I leaned heavily on Sophie Hill's publicly-available code for this, see [here](https://www.sophie-e-hill.com/post/2021-09-12-downloading-the-census-household-pulse-survey-in-r/)). If I keep working with the story, there's some more of this kind of work I'd like to do too.
