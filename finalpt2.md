This week, I built out the narrative for my eviction story. Digging into my message revealed areas where I could use additional data, so I spent some time searching for that. I also thought more about my audience and got some feedback from the kinds of people that I hope to ultimately persuade with my story.

## Step 1: Wireframing

I opted to create a detailed storyboard in Shorthand. I wrote a first draft of the story text and used a combination of real-data visualizations and sketches.

I'm looking forward to filling out my story with more of my actual data soon. Some of the additional sources I found in the past week include data on housing instability from the [Census Household Pulse Survey](/https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products/household-pulse-survey.html) and information on the effects of eviction from a [research paper](/chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/viewer.html?pdfurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.law.nyu.edu%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fupload_documents%2Fevictions_collinson_reed.pdf&clen=796581&chunk=true). Most of my data sources require work to make them usable, like cleaning and even scraping (the Pulse Survey, for instance, needs to be scraped to efficiently access historical data). I'm excited to be wrapping up this part of the work and moving towards creating more polished visualizations in the next week.

## Step 2: User research and interviews

Developing my story required more thought about my target audience. Eviction is a personal topic for me: for the past year, I have worked with a project that helps tenants who are facing eviction to navigate the court system in Pittsburgh. Even though I've worked in the space for a while, I sometimes have a hard time explaining the significance of projects like this to my friends and family. I have noticed that eviction can be a divisive issue, even among people who may otherwise have political beliefs a lot like my own, so my plan is start by persuading people who are similar to me.

This helped me develop my research protocol:
* My target audience is people like me: young adults who already care about the values motivating eviction prevention (i.e. advancing equity, making communities more livable), but may not know the severity of eviction in Pittsburgh or the policy interventions that could be introduced to address it. 
* I reached out to friends for interviews who represented different age groups, genders, and academic backgrounds. 
* My interviewees answered four questions:
  * Can you describe what each section of the storyboard is telling you?
  * Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
  * Is there anything you would change or do differently?
  * Do you think that eviction was a problem during the pandemic? Do you think it is a problem now?

I got feedback from three friends: an early 20s woman in the entertainment industry, a late 20s man in business school, and an early 30s woman who works in journalism. Each of them gave me detailed feedback on all sections of the storyboard, so I'm summarizing their thoughts at each point of the narrative below:

### Introduction: Eviction is a problem today, but protections are limited.

After seeing the word "moratorium" on my title slide, all of my friends expected to hear about evictions during the pandemic. Despite not having a strong prior interest in eviction, all of them were aware of Covid policies like the CDC eviction moratorium.

### Background: Outlining eviction protections from the start of the pandemic to now.

Unfortunately, most of my respndents thought the background section on the different moratoriums (Care, CDC, and Pittsburgh-specific) were pretty boring. Some suggestions were:
* Motivate the moratoriums with more discussion of the data. How many people were behind on rent at different points in the pandemic? What did eviction fililngs look like at different points?
* Move the "behind on rent" visualization up to the introduction, since that's where that concept was introduced. It's distracting to include it with the background.
* Make it more obvious that there is more than one chart in this section. One respondent did not notice that there were two.
* Rewrite the section on the Pittsburgh moratorium more clearly. The distinction between a "case" and an application for rental assistance was not clear. If the case refers to an eviction filing, say "eviction case."

### Background part 2: Mapping the change in eviction protections throughout the US.

Overall, people liked the maps with the progression of eviction prevention policies throughout the US. 
* One respondent said it emphasized the stark change between earlier days of the pandemic and now. 
* Another respondent was initially confused by what filled in states meant. She suggested adding a verbal cue in the text box, like "the CDC moratorium prevented evictions in every state" to explain why the first map is entirely filled in.
* One person was surprised by the 1.55 million number for filings prevented by the CDC moratorium. They said this sounded too low.

### Re-interpreting eviction: Infograms on how it's a problem all the time, not just during the pandemic.

Most respondents liked this section and wanted to know more. One respondent said this was the "human element" of the story and should be included throughout the narrative with more details on how the lingering effects of eviction ripple through someone's life. More in-the-weeds suggestions included:
* Restructure the segment on eviction disproportionately affecting Black tenants. After seeing "disproportionately" in the first sentence of this segment, the user was looking for that disparity in the first data point. But since the disparity isn't clear until the second data point, this was confusing.
* Include more details about the research presented in the infogram on the effects of eviction. What point in time do these statistics refer to?

### Call to action: Policy proposals and what to do if you or a neighbor are facing eviction

* One respondent wanted to know more about the policy proposals included in this section. Is there evidence that these interventions have worked in cities/states where they have been implemented?
* Another respondent was confused about the call to action for Pittsburgh, since no significant policy proposals are being worked on now. They suggested saying clearly that no policies are currently being proposed, but that people should still be aware of and support these things.

### Was eviction a problem during the pandemic? Is it a problem now?

In retrospect, this may have been too much of a leading question to be useful. Most respondents said that eviction is a problem always (which the story clearly prompted them to do). One respondent suggested expanding more on the effects of eviction to convince them that it's a big deal post-pandemic.
