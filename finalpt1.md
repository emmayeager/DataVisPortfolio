## Final project, part 1

Although Pittsburgh residents are still living through a pandemic, eviction courts have returned to business as usual. My final project will explore how eviction protections have shifted throughout the pandemic and give background on why these policies matter, including who is affected by eviction and its consequences. 

### Outline

These are the major points that I plan to hit in my story:
* The potential eviction crisis at the start of the pandemic. This section will include the impact that a wave of evictions would have had at the time (from an economic and public health perspective), as well as the harm that evictions cause all the time (displacement/loss of community, increased risk of homelessness, increased risk of job loss, etc). 
* The first eviction moratorium under the CARES Act (March 2020 to July 2020). In Pittsburgh, this was the most successful tenant protection, holding eviction filings far below historical averages.
* The second eviction moratorium issued by the CDC (September 2020 to August 2021). This was less successful, but still kept eviction filings below historical averages. It was eventually struck down by the Supreme Court. 
* The situation now. Despite high Covid transmission, tenants have extremely limited protections. 
* The potential to extend better tenants protections for the rest of the pandemic and beyond. This section will include potential policies, like mediation, as well as things that people at risk for eviction or their neighbors can do to prevent it. 

### Initial sketches
