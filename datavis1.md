## Visualizing Government Debt

I visualized OECD data on government debt for the G7 countries using the OECD's graphing tool and Flourish. I picked the G7 because it includes the countries with the largest debt-to-GDP ratios globally -- especially Japan, Italy, and the US.

I first looked at debt-to-GDP ratios in 2020 using the OECD's graphing tool:

<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6Bhv" width="860" height="645" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true"><a href="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6Bhv" target="_blank">OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 2020</a></iframe>

The chart shows that Japan has the largest debt-to-GDP ratio by far. I used the ratios for 2020 because all G7 countries have already reported data for that year. The limitations of the OECD's graphing tool were another reason to focus on the G7, since this allowed me to focus on a small set of countries. Had I been able to be more flexible with country selection, I may have included debt-to-GDP ratios for emerging economies like China and India. 

Next, I visualized trends in debt-to-GDP ratios for the G7 over the last decade using Flourish:

I only plotted the last decade of data to call attention to the sharp debt-to-GDP increase for all countries in 2020. I used a steel blue color to match the OECD's default palette.

For the final chart, I stacked all the countries on top of each other in one line plot:

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/8559301"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Plotting the countries together makes it easier to tell which countries have had higher debt-to-GDP ratios over time, which is harder to make out in the sparkline plot. However, the criss crossing series could be hard to follow, so I pushed most countries to the background using the color gray and highlighted the United Kingdom only. I added a story-telling title about how the UK'ss ratio compares to other countries to reinforce the message that the viewer is likely to see first: the UK outpaced France in debt-to-GDP ratios in 2020.
