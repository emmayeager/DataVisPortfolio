## Redesign #1

For our redesign assignment, I chose to focus on a visualization related to affordable housing in Maryland. I found a [fact sheet](https://reports.nlihc.org/oor/maryland) from the National Low Income Housing Coalition that seemed like a good candidate. The fact sheet has rich information about affordable housing, including the definition of affordable housing and how affordability varies by income group and geography. While informative, this is also somewhat overwhelming, especially since redundant sections and confusing color choices pull attention away from the main points. I decided to start with redesigning the bar chart at the bottom right of the sheet.
