# DataVisPortfolio
This is my portfolio of visualizations created for the CMU class _Telling Stories with Data_.

## About me
Hi! My name is Emma (she/her/hers) and I'm a public policy and data analytics Master's candidate. I'm interested in applying data analytics to local policy problems, especially ones related to housing and public transit. Right now, I'm interning with a lab at CMU that uses data analytics to prevent evictions in Allegheny County. 

I like baking, crocheting, and reading. This winter, my roommates and I are learning how to brew beer together.  

Nice to meet you!

## What I hope to learn
I know how to make quick and simple data visualizations with tools like R and Python. I would like to work on making polished and interactive data visualizations in this class.
